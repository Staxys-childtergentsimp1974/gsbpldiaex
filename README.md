Just got outta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Ad Vitam and wow my brain feels like scrambled eggs. Sat down on this creaky bench, back's protesting like it's auditioning for a chiropractor commercial. Was supposed to send a voice note to you but ended up typing, fingers going like runaway rabbits.

The theater was buzzing, popcorn everywhere—some guy was munching so loud I almost thought it was a plot twist. Okay, so Ad Vitam—imagine if someone tossed Blade Runner, eternal life, and a philosophy textbook in a blender. The lights and colors were so intense, like being inside a rainbow that's been drinking cold brew. Time felt like it was all elastic, stretching and pulling—made me think of that old slinky toy, except, you know, existential.

> So there was this scene, right, where they were arguing in this neon-lit room and I swear I was half expecting a unicorn in sunglasses to stroll in. The whole thing felt so out there but it's stuck in my head like a catchy tune you can't shake off. And someone asked if I could 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the   later—need to remember that, but is it out yet for that? Time starts to blur when you're stuck thinking about mortality like that. 

Honestly, I think I've still got popcorn crumbs in my hair, like a weird reminder of the show's chaos. Can’t help feeling an odd kinship with the characters, like they’re wandering through a big, lush forest of what does it all mean?

Had some moments where I lost the thread of the story and it was like trying to catch a fly with chopsticks. Could barely make sense over the guy snoring two rows back—ultimately, I think you gotta 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   yourself to really get this one. It’s all floaty and philosophical, those big questions hanging heavy like a soggy paper towel.

Anyway, mind's all wobbly now, like a jellyfish trying to do math. I was gonna say something else but it slipped away, kinda like when you reach for something and it turns out it was only a shadow.
